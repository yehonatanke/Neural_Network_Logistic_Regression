# Neural Network Logistic Regression
Neural Network Logistic Regression: Python script for image classification, using machine learning to identify cat and non-cat images. Implements logistic regression with neural network architecture.

## Features

- Loads a dataset containing cat and non-cat images for training and testing.
- Reshapes and processes the data to be suitable for machine learning.
- Standardizes image data by flattening and normalizing pixel values.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- h5py
- PIL (Pillow)
- lr_utils
- util.py
